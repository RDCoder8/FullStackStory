/* 
I want to make a turn-based, story battle that displays text in a box, has two actors on field, and changes the ending of the story based on whether the player has defeated the opposing actor or not through the choices they made. 

First I will need classes for the player (New Software Engineer) and CodeBeast (Opposing Actor). They will need properties such as HP and Attack. Also because it is a story, there will be dialogue or lines said between each attack cycle/round. 

I will need a way to store the text lines and show them on the screen. Also I will likely need a way to clear them based on the player pushing a key or clicking.

Win-lose conditions will determine the ending of the story but the player can select different methods from a menu to attack the CodeBeast.

Player Attack Methods include Attack, Research, Summon, and Procrasinate.
